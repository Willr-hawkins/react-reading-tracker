# ðŸ“š Book Reading Tracker

A React-based application to manage your personal reading library with progress tracking and filtering capabilities.

## About This Project

This project was built as a practice exercise while learning React fundamentals. The challenge and requirements were provided by Claude AI to help solidify key React concepts including state management, component composition, and working with complex data structures. While I received guidance on certain features (progress bars, rating system, and sorting logic), the core architecture and implementation were completed independently.

This is part of a series of progressively challenging React projects designed to build practical coding skills and demonstrate understanding of modern React development patterns.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Store books with title, author, genre, and page count
- **Reading Status**: Track books as "Want to Read", "Currently Reading", or "Finished"
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor reading progress with visual progress bars for books currently being read
- **Rating System**: Rate finished books with a 5-star rating system
- **Filtering**: Filter books by reading status and genre
- **Sorting**: Sort your library by title (A-Z) or rating (High to Low)
- **Statistics**: View total books, books read, and average rating at a glance

## Technologies Used

- React (Hooks: useState)
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+

## What I Learned

Building this project helped me practice and solidify:
- Complex state management with objects in arrays
- Updating nested object properties immutably
- Multiple simultaneous filters
- Array sorting and filtering methods
- Conditional rendering based on status
- Form handling and validation
- Component composition and props drilling
- Responsive design with CSS Grid

## Running the Project Locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Local storage persistence
- Search functionality
- Reading goals and streaks
- Book cover images
- Reading statistics graphs
